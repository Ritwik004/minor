											<h3>Srijan 2017</h3>
											<p>
                                                    
                                                     Srijan, brain child of Sister Nivedita Takniki Siksha Samiti, is a festival for engineering and pharmacy students   
organised at various engineering and pharmacy institutes of Madhya Pradesh. It aims to provide a platform to the students to  
showcase their creativity and innovativeness either by way of making models or by presenting technical research papers in  
their respective branches. It also provides students with an opportunity to participate in many other activities like Quiz, Rangoli, Robotics, Poster Etc.

 Srijan takes pride in bringing about a change in the mindset of some of the engineering colleges of the region. Due to  
overcapacity in engineering education, most colleges had resorted to publishing advertisements, giving discounts and using  
services of brokers.
